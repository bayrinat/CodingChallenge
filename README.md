### Coding Challenge

1. Implement a function that takes two integers a and b and returns their product, without using
the '*' operator.
2. Implement a function that takes a sorted array of integers A and an integer x and returns the
position of x in A or -1 if x is not in A.
3. Implement a function that takes two strings a and b and returns a boolean indicating whether
a is an anagram of b. Comment on your implementation.
4. Design a simple REST-api for a small dance studio. Users can login, book a specific date and
time to have a dance lesson, pay by credit card or by paypal and rare their lesson after they are
done.
5. If you were to follow a product-first approach, how would your answer to (4) change, if at all.
6. Describe in detail how would you unit-test the API in (4) and how would you do proper
integration testing. Describe at least the basic test cases.
